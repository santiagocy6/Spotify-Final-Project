# Spotify-Final-Project



This project uses machine learning models such as random forests and logistic regression to predict the genre of a song using its features or attributes. I also perform exploratory data analysis. The goal of this project is to develop my competence in classification and regression problems. The primary libraries used are pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn and scikit learn. The project additionally explores the concept of hyperparameter tuning, and how they can be leveraged to combat under or overfitting of the model.
